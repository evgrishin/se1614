You can't keep up with it. This social phenomenon is very whimsical, thus we as the consumers always try to stay in touch with all the latest fashion tendencies. Obviously there is nothing wrong about it because fashion satisfies our willingness to be attractive. And also fashion is the detector of prosperity and social rank. So, our natural desire to wear fashionable clothes has many reasons such as historical, social and others. Therefore being fashionable costs a lot of money. But nowadays fashion is not such unavailable as it was a couple of centuries ago. We are lucky to have an opportunity to buy qualitative, fashionable and affordable clothes.</p>
